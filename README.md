# ethminer
This container is a CUDA enabled build of ethereum-mining/ethminer. It tracks the head of the
master branch at build time. I used the guidance provided in the
[build.md](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer/blob/master/docs/BUILD.md)
of the repository to put this image together.

## Tip Jar
If you're using this container image, tips in eth are appreciated! :bowtie:

## Overview
To minimize the complexity of pulling in the required dependencies and
minimizing the size of the image, I use the
nvidia/cuda devel image to build the ethminer binary. In the second
stage, I copy the build artifacts to a new image dependent on
nvidia/cuda runtime.

The entrypoint for the final image is /opt/rethminer/rethminer.

This provides the ability to pass arguments at container execution time. For
example:

```
$ docker run --gpus all -it kriation/ethminer:latest --list-devices

The prerequisite to using this image is that the NVIDIA container toolkit is
configured properly on the container host. The
[documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/user-guide.html)
from NVIDIA on setting the toolkit up is straightforward.

## Build
For those interested in building a custom image that isn't available in Docker
Hub, you can pass a build argument of CUDA_VERSION set to any of the tags
listed in the [CUDA Supported Tags](https://gitlab.com/nvidia/container-images/cuda/blob/master/doc/supported-tags.md) documentation.

An example is below:

```
$ docker build --build-arg CUDA_VERSION=10.0 -t paymentz/rethminer:10.0 .
```

The resulting image will be based off of the CUDA 10.0 base.
